Password Generator Application

I developed a Password Generator application in Python using Tkinter, offering users a simple interface to generate secure passwords. Here are the key components and functionalities of the application:

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
   - Created a Tkinter window with labels, an entry field, and a button for user interaction.
   - Ensured the window size is fixed and non-resizable to maintain layout integrity.

2. Password Generation:
   - Implemented password generation logic based on user-defined length.
   - Utilized a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters to generate strong passwords.

3. User Input Processing:
   - Validated user input to ensure the password length is a positive integer.
   - Provided a warning message if the specified password length is considered too short for security.

4. Result Display and Clipboard Copy:
   - Displayed the generated password in a pop-up window for user convenience.
   - Copied the generated password to the clipboard for easy access and usage in other applications.

5. Main Functionality:
   - Defined a main function to initialize the Tkinter window and the PasswordGeneratorApp instance.
   - Launched the Tkinter event loop to handle user interactions and application events.

This Password Generator application demonstrates my proficiency in GUI development with Tkinter, input validation, and integration with system utilities like the clipboard.
